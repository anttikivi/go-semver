The `go-semver` package provides utilities and a parser to work with version
numbers that adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). It is designed
to perform relatively well compared to common alternatives: the package
implements custom parser instead of using regular expressions, which seems to be
faster.

## Install

    go get github.com/anttikivi/go-semver

## Usage

The module exports a couple of functions to use. The functions accept version
strings that adhere to the semantic versioning. The version strings may start
with a `v` prefix.

The functions also have `Prefix` counterparts that accept one or more prefix
strings that will be allowed in front of the strings. For example, if you want
your version strings to have the form `go1.2.3`, you can pass `"go"` as a prefix
to the prefix version of a function.

**`Parse`**

As youâ€™d expect, this function takes a version string and parses it into a
`Version`. To use a custom prefix, use the `ParsePrefix` function. To panic
instead of returning an error on failure, use `MustParse` or `MustParsePrefix`
functions.

**`IsValid`**

Checks if the given string is a valid version string. To use a custom prefix,
use the `IsValidPrefix` function.
