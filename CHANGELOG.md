# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Version.Core` function that returns the version as a string without the build
  identifiers.
- `Version.StrictEqual` function that compares the whole version data to
  determine the equality of two versions, including build metadata.
- `IsValidLax` for checking if partial version strings are valid.
- `ParseLax` and `MustParseLax` for parsing partial version strings.
- `Version.Compare` and `Prerelease.Compare` for comparing versions and
  pre-releases respectively.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Change all of the number values in the versions to `uint64`s.
- **BREAKING:** `Version.Equal` function to only compare the version parts up to
  the build metadata as the build metadata is not comparable in the semantic
  versioning specification.
- **BREAKING:** `Version.String` to include the build metadata in the string.
- **BREAKING:** Change the `Prerelease` type to be a simple slice of pre-release
  identifiers.

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** The `Prefix` variants of the functions: `IsValidPrefix`,
  `ParsePrefix`, and `MustParsePrefix` as the Go standard library offers an easy
  way to remove prefixes from strings.
- Private `rawStr` field from `Version` struct.

### Fixed

- Fix the version parser accepting any character after the patch version without
  returning an error.
- Fix `IsValid` accepting version strings that had leading zero.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-01

### Added

- New implementation for functions `IsValid` and `IsValidPrefix` that doesnâ€™t
  parse the version but just checks for the validity. This drastically speeds up
  checking whether a string is a valid version.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-31

- Initial release of the project.
- Functions `Parse` and `MustParse` for parsing version strings.
- Functions `ParsePrefix` and `MustParsePrefix` for parsing version strings with
  optional prefixes.
